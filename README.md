## Insights
The count of earthquakes around each region vary. The one with the most eartquakes is Nicaragua by about 234% more than the ones occurred in the US. This is due to the fact that Nicaragua is located in Central America where there are several volcanoes and also tectonique plaques Coco and Caribean at the East and West respectively. It is important to highlight that the earthquakes are distributed around Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, El Salvador, Panam√° and Guatemala. However, this countries are not as large as the United States. So, If we could compare the quantity by the total area affected, Central America would have the highest ratio.
